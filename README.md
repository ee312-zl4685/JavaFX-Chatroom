Chat Room

The purpose of this lab was using [Socket Programming](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/) to create a simple chat client. We created a JavaFX based GUI for the clients. We also implemented some additional features such as private messaging, sound notifications, skins, and emoticon support.
